## Principles
- this page is meant to be comprehensive - but it is updated with time
- if you have any suggestions, don't feel any hesitations to open a pull request 
- the selection of articles and books are somewhat opinionated
- I don't necessarily agree with or endorse every single line that is written in every single one of those resources
